Activity: Create a conditional statement by Kiernan Rodriguez

Introduction:

Conditional statements are a powerful structure that help in achieving automation when you need
to make sure conditions are met before certain actions are executed. For example, security analysts
can use conditional statements in Python to check if users are approved to access a device.

Scenario:

You’re working as a security analyst. First, you are responsible for checking whether a user’s
operating system requires an update. Then, you need to investigate login attempts to a specific
device. You must determine if login attempts were made by users approved to access this device
and if the login attempts occurred during organization hours.
